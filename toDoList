TOH - iterative (stack ?)
Prime factorization (better optimal methods)
Powerset (optimal way using stacks / queues)
Sum of Divisors (optimal efficient method)

Recurrence relations - study theory + use it for time complexity of permutaitons and binary search

Arrays and Structures : Sparse Matrix Addition and Multiplication

Additional Exercises after KMP Algo : Saddle Point of Matrix, Triangular Matrix, Diagonal Matrix, Square Band Matrix, Random walk and knights

RailRoadSwitch Permutations

Infix to postfix for all operators and operands + Multiple stacks, additional excercises

Queues --> lot of stuff

Paranthesis matching
